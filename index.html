                <h2>Fitnesss</h2>

                <p>Many parents think of extracurricular activities like organized sports as a simple leisure (or even luxury) activity for their children.  
                    reality, the benefits of sports for youth offer surprisingly varied and far-reaching physical health advantages. Participating in sports not
                    only getskids moving after sitting in class all day, but can set them up for success for the rest of their lives.
                    Here are just a few examples of the physical benefits of playing sports for kids.

                    Although participation in extracurricular sports is quite common among middle- and upper-class youth in the US, children who grow
                    up in low-income communities and nations are at risk of missing out on the benefits of playing sports. You can give the potentially 
                    life-changing gift of athletic opportunities to children in developing countries like Uganda by donating to nonprofit organizations 
                    whose missions support the health and education of young Ugandans.
